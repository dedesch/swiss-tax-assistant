You are an expert frontend engineer and conversion copywriter. Build a production-ready, responsive landing page for a Swiss tax assistant SaaS that helps individuals complete their Swiss tax declaration, as an affordable alternative to human tax experts (typically CHF 150–600+ per filing).

### Tech + Output
- Produce a single-page app: `index.html`, `styles.css` (or Tailwind CDN), and `app.js` with minimal vanilla JS.
- Use Tailwind (via CDN) and semantic HTML5 for accessibility.
- No build step required; must run by opening `index.html`.
- Include favicon, Open Graph/Twitter tags, and JSON-LD schema.

### Branding
- Temporary product name placeholder: {{PRODUCT_NAME}} (e.g., “HelvetiTax”, “Fiscora”, or “TaxPilot”).
- Swiss-inspired palette: Swiss Red `#D00000`, Alpine Blue `#1E3A8A`, Neutral Grey `#6B7280`, White `#FFFFFF`. Use lots of whitespace and clean typography (Inter or system font stack).
- Simple logo lockup: a cross/checkbox motif + {{PRODUCT_NAME}} (SVG inline).

### Hero (above the fold)
- Headline (localized): 
  - EN: “Your Swiss Tax Declaration—Done Right in Minutes”
  - FR: “Votre déclaration d’impôts en Suisse, en quelques minutes”
  - DE: “Ihre Schweizer Steuererklärung – in wenigen Minuten erledigt”
  - IT: “La tua dichiarazione fiscale svizzera, in pochi minuti”
- Subheadline: “AI-assisted guidance tailored to your canton, with checks to avoid costly mistakes.”
- Primary CTA button: “Start for Free” → scroll to pricing and signup form.
- Secondary CTA: “See How It Works” → scroll to product tour.
- Trust badges row: “Data encrypted • Works for all cantons • GDPR compliant • No hidden fees”.

### Language Switcher
- Top-right dropdown with EN/FR/DE/IT. All visible copy must switch language instantly (store translations in a JS object; default to FR). Persist selection in `localStorage`.

### Social Proof
- Rotating testimonials (3–5) with name, canton (e.g., “ZH”), and short quote (localized strings).
- “As seen in” placeholder logos (neutral grayscale) — easily replaceable.

### How It Works (3–4 steps)
1) Answer a few questions by canton.
2) We prefill deductions and check for missed benefits.
3) Generate the official tax files/forms or a ready-to-submit package.
4) Optional human review add-on (paid).

Include simple icons and a light animated scroll reveal.

### Product Tour
- Three feature cards with mini screenshots/placeholders:
  - Smart Questionnaire (by canton & family status)
  - Deduction Checker (housing, kids, 2nd pillar, commuting, etc.)
  - Error/Compliance Checks (avoid common mistakes)
- An expandable section for “Expat mode” and “Cross-border scenarios”.

### Pricing (with comparison vs tax experts)
- Pricing grid (all localized labels):
  - **Starter** – CHF 39 / filing: 1 declaration; guided flow; PDF export.
  - **Plus** – CHF 79 / filing: all Starter + deduction checker + live chat.
  - **Pro** – CHF 149 / filing: all Plus + *optional* human review (24–48h SLA) + priority support.
- Small line: “Typical tax expert = CHF 150–600+ per filing. Save up to 75%.”
- Include a **mini ROI calculator** widget:
  - Inputs: “What did you pay last year?” (CHF), “Time spent” (hours).
  - Output: “Estimated savings vs {{PRODUCT_NAME}}” (simple calc in JS; show CHF and hours saved).
- CTA: “Start for Free” (email capture) and “Contact Sales” (for bundles).

### Comparison Table
Columns: {{PRODUCT_NAME}} vs “Typical Tax Expert”
Rows: Price per filing, Turnaround, Canton-specific guidance, Deduction checks, Data privacy, Availability, Upsell (human review). Show where {{PRODUCT_NAME}} wins on speed/price; acknowledge the expert’s strength (bespoke complex cases).

### Lead Capture & Onboarding
- Email field + canton dropdown + “Get Started” button. Validate inputs; show success state.
- GDPR checkbox (localized) with link to Privacy Policy and Terms.
- Optional “Book a 15-min demo” button (placeholder Calendly link `#`).

### FAQ (8–10 Q/A)
Include localized entries:
- Is it valid for my canton?
- Can I import last year’s data?
- How do you handle dependents/children?
- Is my data secure and private?
- Can I still talk to a human?
- Refund policy?
- When do I need a tax expert instead?
- How do I submit to the authorities?

### Footer
- Links: Pricing, FAQ, Security, Privacy, Terms, Contact.
- Address placeholder (Switzerland), contact email placeholder, social links.
- Cookie consent banner (basic) with “Accept all” / “Manage”.

### SEO & Performance
- Fast LCP (optimize hero, lazy-load images).
- Meta title/description per language.
- JSON-LD `Organization` + `Product` + `FAQPage`.
- Canonical link, sitemap placeholder.
- Basic `robots.txt`.

### Analytics & Integrations (placeholders)
- Out-of-the-box `window.analytics.track()` hooks on CTAs.
- Commented placeholders for Plausible or GA4.
- Placeholder Stripe Checkout link buttons (no keys required).
- Placeholder support chat widget loader.

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigable, focus styles, aria-labels, sufficient color contrast.
- Forms with labels and error messages.

### Copywriting (provide localized defaults)
Create concise, reassuring copy in EN/FR/DE/IT for:
- Hero headline & subheadline
- CTA labels
- Feature blurbs (40–60 chars each)
- Pricing plan descriptions
- Comparison row content
- 10 FAQ Q/As (2–3 lines each)
- Cookie banner text
Store all strings in a `translations` object keyed by language.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Page looks modern, trustworthy, and Swiss-flavored.
- Language switcher updates ALL visible text instantly.
- Pricing and comparison clearly show savings vs CHF 150–600+ expert fees.
- ROI calculator works and updates on input.
- Email capture validates and shows success.
- JSON-LD valid, and the page passes basic Lighthouse checks.
- All static assets are placeholders that I can easily swap later.

Deliver now the three files (`index.html`, `styles.css` if not using Tailwind CDN, and `app.js`). Ensure everything runs with no build step.
